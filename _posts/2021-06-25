Hello again DREU, I missed you! I had a fantastic summer last year and did loads of research that made me more than eager for grad school. I also presented that research at several conferences and I have even more coming up! The biggest win for my DREU project came from NCWIT, though... I won honorable mention for the NCWIT Collegiate Award! They sent me a fancy trophy and everything!

I'm looking for another fun summer of research that expands on what I did last year, and I'm hoping to continue presenting that research at conferenes. Last year we didn't get the scope of the project narrow enough, but this summer it's easy: the goal is to create a software package for astronomers that will let them put in a light curve (change in brightness over time) and tell them whether there is an eclipse or not. This will use a machine learning model that I will have to create, which is a big deal! Time to hit the ground running.
