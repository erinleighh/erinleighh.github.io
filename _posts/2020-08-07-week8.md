title: Week 8
---

Woohoo! I have things to report this week! Granted, I probably spent...way more than 40 hours this week, but hey--astronomy and computer science are special interests! (And as an Autistic adult, diving headfirst into special interests for hours on end is my bread and butter.)

This week was all about making minor changes trying to perfect performance, both in computation time and accuracy. I brought back smoothing (and it works now) and added a 'clipping' to the data. Since most of the data errors are at the very beginning or at the very end of data collection AND look like eclipses, clipping the edges might help cut down on the false positives. I tried about five different iterations this week and they keep getting better! However, the clipping is causing some serious performance issues and I need to look into that next week.
