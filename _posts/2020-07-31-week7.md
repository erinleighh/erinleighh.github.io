title: Week 7
---

Unfortunately this was another slow week for me. Visiting my family for the first time in months, when I normally visit them weekly during the summer, was hard and left me feeling vulnerable. I appreciate the efforts our Governor is doing to ensure public safety, and I wish more Governors treated Covid as seriously as he is, but I can't wait for all of this to be over so I could go back to my semi-regular visits. Stay healthy and mask up, everyone!
