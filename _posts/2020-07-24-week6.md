I'll admit--I didn't get much work done this week. This week was all about comet hunting! Luckily my mentor (and virtually all astronomy buffs) were out and about looking for Comet Neowise, which was in the neighborhood this week. I got some excellent pictures on my Twitter:

It was gorgeous and so thrilling! It reminded me of the time when Comet Hale-Bopp visited us in the mid-90s. That little two-tailed comet was one of the reasons that I started looking to the stars for inspiration. As I grew older, that love never faded, and once I found out how important my first love (computing) is to astronomy? Well, it felt like destiny.
